This is a full upload of the (currently) only known copy of the Climate Change Game's project files. See the "main" branch for more information on the game. Some notable changes have been made from the "release" version:

- Some assets that originally had "whitespace" around them were made transparent.
- An incomplete menu script was added.

These changes were made fairly soon after the game was finished, so I don't think a completely unmodified version of the project files exists. Apart from that, I'm not sure what else was modified, but builds made from this codebase seem to produce identical behaviour to the "release" build.
